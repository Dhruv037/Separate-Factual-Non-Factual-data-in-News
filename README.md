# Separate Factual & Non-Factual data in News
Newspaper articles are major sources of information about current affairs and events occurring throughout the world. News article usually contains a mixture of factual statements and non-factual statements. A fact can be considered as something that can be proven to be true. With respect to news articles, events which have actually happened and statements which can be proved to be true are considered as factual in nature, whereas non-factual data includes, opinions, beliefs, inferences, predictions, etc. The problem of separating factual data and non-factual data is considered as a classical NLP problem. We have developed SVM classifier and LSTM models for classifying facts and non-facts in news article, and compared their efficiencies.
